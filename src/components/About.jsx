      <p>
        My journey into software engineering started when I took courses at freecodecamp.org, since then my love for coding grew. 
        <br/><br/>
        I decided to enroll in Fullstack Academy. That is where I learned full-stack development, debugging code and algorithims. 
        <br/><br/>
        I love solving problems, in my career as a plumber and automation support specialist, I honed my problem-solving skills to a maximum.
